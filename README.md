## Contributing

## Style

This is written in a different style than [mapschool](http://mapschool.io/) and
other projects: the tone of voice is meant to be casual and friendly: the word
'you' is used. 'data' is used as a singular noun rather than a plural of
datum, so usage matches common American English.
