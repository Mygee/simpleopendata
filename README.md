# Simple Open Data

So you want to publish some open data? Cheers! - you're awesome. Here are some
helpful hints to make it simple and effective.

## Goals

Why should you publish open data?

* **Using open methods of sharing can make your organization more efficient internally.** When you pay attention to how data is published, packaged, and managed, it's easier to point other departments to good resources, and easier for them to use those resources.
* **A wider audience means having more creativity and types of talent invested in understanding your data.** The most interesting uses can be unexpected - like cross-referenced studies or visualization projects that bring public attention to the details.

## Use Open Formats

Having a wider audience means changing your expectations for how they'll use data. You might use a particular operating system and software, and even have a site license for software - but others don't, and software can be prohibitively expensive. Why bother making data free if it costs thousands of dollars to open the file?

Luckily there are many simple, open formats that are supported widely, by commercial and free products and across operating systems.

### Text

**Avoid publishing text as Microsoft Word files.** There are multiple incompatible versions of the format and they are read inconsistently outside of Microsoft products.

**Publishing text as PDF is okay.** But remember that some of the purported benefits of PDF are myths: it is easily possible to edit any PDF file, so the files aren't any more tamper-proof than any other format.

If your text is minimally styled, prefer a simple format. **.txt** files are the simplest format possible, and easy to read in any system.

### Tables

**Never publish tabular data as PDF.** It's nearly impossible to read this data with a computer, and so potential users need to do a lot of manual work to parse or re-type the data.

**The best format for publishing table data is [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). CSV stands for 'Comma-separated values', and is an option for Microsoft Excel's exports.
